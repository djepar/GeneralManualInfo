        <dd><quote>A PAN is the smallest type of network and has a limited span, interconnecting personal devices such as those that are Bluetooth enabled.</quote></dd>

        <dd>
            <quote>A LAN is a network commonly used to interconnect and share computer resources inside a building or multiple buildings in a limited area.  </quote>

        <dt>Campus Area network (CAN)</dt>
        <dd>
            <quote>A CAN -- often called simple an enterprise network -- spans multiple buildings in a campus environment such as a university or another large organization.</quote>

        <dt>Metropolitan area network (MAN)</dt>
        <dd>
            <quote>A MAN spans multiple buildings in a city area</quote>

        <dt>Wide area network (WAN)</dt>
        <dd>
            <quote>A WAN is much larger than the other network types and can span many areas such as cities, states or countries. </quote>

        <h3 id="Network-Topologies">Network Topologies</h3>
        <p>Topology : the architecture of a network</p>
        <h4>Token-Ring Topology</h4>
        <img src="Figures/fig1.png" alt="Ring Topology">
        <p>Works through the passing of a token around the ring. </p>
        <p>It's a deterministics network, meaning each station connected to the network is ensured access for transmission of its message at regular or fixed intervals.</p>
        <p>Disadvantages : IP error message, token may stall, must break circle to add/remove a device. </p>
        <h4>Star Topology</h4>
        <img src="Figures/fig2.png" alt="Schematic Star Topology">
        <img src="Figures/fig3.png" alt="Start Topology">
        <p>Most common networking Topology in today's LANs. </p>
        <p>All the devices are connected to a hub or a switch. They act as a multiport reader : "which means the data it receives is broadcast and seem by all devices connected to its ports." </p>
        <h4>Bus Topology</h4>
        <img src="Figures/fig4.png" alt="Bus topology">
        <p>The computers share the media for data transmission through a coaxial cable.</p>
        <h4>Mesh Topology</h4>
        <img src="Figures/fig5.png" alt="Mesh Topology">
        <p>All networking devices are all connected to each other. It's a costly installation, but useful for high-reliability application. </p>

    <h2>The OSI Model</h2>
    <section>
        <!--  Networking Essentials : Sixth edition by Jeffrey S. Beasley and Piyasat Nilkaew chapter 1 p.12-14 -->
        <h3>Overview of the OSI Model</h3>
        <quote>The OSI Model Contains seven layers that describe networking functions from the physical network interface to the software application interfaces.</quote>
        <p>At each layer, they are different protocol that operate.</p>
        <quote>Each layer performs data encapsulation by putting its own message format or header onto the data as it is being passed down from layer 7 to layer 1 for transmission. </quote>
