        <p>Topology : the architecture of a network</p>
        <h4>Token-Ring Topology</h4>
        <img src="Figures/fig1.png" alt="Ring Topology">
        <p>Works through the passing of a token around the ring. </p>
        <p>It's a deterministics network, meaning each station connected to the network is ensured access for transmission of its message at regular or fixed intervals.</p>
        <p>Disadvantages : IP error message, token may stall, must break circle to add/remove a device. </p>
        <h4>Star Topology</h4>
        <img src="Figures/fig2.png" alt="Schematic Star Topology">
        <img src="Figures/fig3.png" alt="Start Topology">
        <p>Most common networking Topology in today's LANs. </p>
        <p>All the devices are connected to a hub or a switch. They act as a multiport reader : "which means the data it receives is broadcast and seem by all devices connected to its ports." </p>
        <h4>Bus Topology</h4>
        <img src="Figures/fig4.png" alt="Bus topology">
        <p>The computers share the media for data transmission through a coaxial cable.</p>
        <h4>Mesh Topology</h4>
        <img src="Figures/fig5.png" alt="Mesh Topology">
        <p>All networking devices are all connected to each other. It's a costly installation, but useful for high-reliability application. </p>

        <h3>Overview of the OSI Model</h3>
        <quote>The OSI Model Contains seven layers that describe networking functions from the physical network interface to the software application interfaces.</quote>
        <p>At each layer, they are different protocol that operate.</p>
        <quote>Each layer performs data encapsulation by putting its own message format or header onto the data as it is being passed down from layer 7 to layer 1 for transmission. </quote>
